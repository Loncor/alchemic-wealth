Here we go, my first **real** blog. The purpose of it is to introduce my "Soft-wares" to anyone who is interested.

Several years ago  I started to put together a **Personal Wealth Management System** to record my financial transactions. It slowly morphed into a **Share Trade Management** and **[Backtesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting) system**. After numerous tests I realized the various techniques commonly suggested in Share Trading Technical Analysis could not be applied *easily* as computer algorithms. I've had some positive results doing [algorithmic trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_trading_system) but not enough to put real money on. I do, however use the Money Management system do decide when to sell my shares.

Having said *trading by algorithms* is not easy, part of the reason I have [open-sourced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) this code is to allow others to *plug-in* algorithmic trading code to achieve that original intention.
