Here we go, my first _real_ blog. The purpose of it is to introduce my "Soft-wares" to anyone who is interested. Several years ago  I started to put together a **Personal Wealth Management System** to record my financial transactions. It slowly morphed into a **Share Trade Management** and **[Backtesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting) system**. After numerous tests I realized the various techniques commonly suggested in Technical Analysis could not be applied easily as computer algorithms. There were some positive results doing algorithmic trading but not enough to put real money on. I do however use the Money Management system do decide when to sell my shares. Having said that there is a one company I know of that has a proved track record using algorithmic trading.

For a reason I might explain later I decided to share some of my Database development experience on the web. I'm not do not have much web development experience but I do have a limited amount of web pages in the system.
