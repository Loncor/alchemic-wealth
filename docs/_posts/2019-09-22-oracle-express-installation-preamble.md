In October 2018 William Hardie from Oracle Corporation announced Oracle Database 18c XE. It is a free, community supported edition of their popular Database. These **Express Edition** databases are not released **too** often as with the list below.

Database Version|Year of Release
----------------------------- | -----
Oracle Database 10g XE|2005
Oracle Database 11g XE|2011
Oracle Database 18c XE|2018

So, if you are upgrading you will be jumping from Oracle XE 10/11g to Oracle XE 18c this is a quite a jump. In a Company or Organisation that task would be major undertaking because of extensive testing required notwithstanding all the development and installation involved. I have been involved in many Oracle Database upgrades over the years and Oracle Corporation has increasingly made it easier to upgrade from one release to the next.

I have been running my own Oracle Express installations for many years and recently decided to make the move from Oracle XE 11g to Oracle XE 18c. I decided to do **least effort** upgrade rather than following **best practice**.

Here are the steps for the [Microsoft Windows version](oracle-express-installation-windows.html).
