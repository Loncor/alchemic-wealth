title: Oracle Development Standards
layout: default

The standards proposed here were developed for this project - **{{layout.project_name}}**. With the exception of this page I have not included any **project specific information** in the standards so they can be used in other projects.

There are three variations: *Basic*, *Complex* and *Extended* to suit the level of standardization desired.

* The *Complex* variation is used for **this project**.

* The *Basic* variation is similar to **other development standards** I have come across during my career.

* The *Extended* variation requires significant changes to any mature Database they were applied to. This would also require a standard of naming columns that would be in sympathy with these naming standards.

[Steven Feuerstein](https://stevenfeuerstein.com/) (famous in the Oracle PL/SQL world) has put together collection of [Naming Conventions for Oracle Database Development](http://stevenfeuersteinonplsql.blogspot.com/2016/10/naming-conventions-for-oracle-database.html) if you would like further reading on this riveting subject.

A number of Oracle Standards came from [Oracle Designer](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/designer/overview/index-082236.html). This system created DDL scripts to create tables and other objects and it automatically assigned suffixes to their name object names. See [Naming Conventions](https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/naming-conventions) on the [Oracle Base](https://oracle-base.com/) website.
