The **{{layout.project_name}}** project is a **Wealth Management** system that includes a number of financial facilities, including:-

* **Wealth Dashboard** - Covering Shares, Cash, Credit Cards, Property and Loans
* **Share Portfolio Management** - Tracking the purchase and sale of shares.
* **Share Management** - Managing [Trailing Stops](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingstop.asp) for Shares
* **Share Trading Strategies Testing** - Apply trading strategies to historical trading data to check validity, tracking profit and loss. Commonly call [Backtesting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtesting).
* **Property Management** - Tenant Payment Ledger
* **Accounting** - Basic Banking and Accounting. Recording all transactions required for the Wealth Dashboard.

I developed it part-time over past 10 years to manage my own Trading and Finances. I have a personalized version of it, but have decided to share some generic code and test data in the spirit of open source.

One of the benefits of running your own Database is you can customize it to upload any financial data, say Broker Calls, to analyze the effectiveness of that data in deciding in Shares Trading.

### Origins
My original idea was to test different trading strategies that are promoted in numerous *Share Trading* books to see if they could be tested using historic trading data. I never found any true 'magic formula' to buy and sell shares but came to the opinion that share trading should be managed in a *systematic way* rather than by *human emotions*.

### Software Development Roadmap

I will be releasing the generic code in stages. It will be from the foundation up, rather than Top Down. Most of the modules are already written but it will take some time to _de-customize_ the modules. So as a simplified Roadmap is:-

1. Project Overview
1. High Level System design
1. Develop standards
1. Build Scripts
1. De-customize Code
1. Test De-customize Code
1. Publish to [Github](https://github.com/about)

### Disclaimer
It is appropriate to issue an _emphatic_ disclaimer. I am not a financial advisor, do not work for any financial advisory company in any capacity. I have previously worked for financial organizations in the past but purely in a software developmental capacity. All software systems provided through this website or from me Stanley Wilson are purely experimental and does not promise the user will make any money or stop the user from losing money. All statements are just opinions and cannot be taken as factual. The systems provided here are partially tested and have not had rigorous testing normally seen with most commercial software.
