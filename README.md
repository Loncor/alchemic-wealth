* **Wealth Dashboard** - Covering Shares, Cash, Credit Cards, Property and Loans
* **Share Portfolio Management** - Tracking the purchase and sale of shares.
* **Share Management** - Managing [Trailing Stops](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trailingstop.asp) for Shares

I developed it part-time over past 10 years to manage my own Trading and Finances. I have a personalized version of it, but have decided to share some generic code and test data in the spirit of open source.
